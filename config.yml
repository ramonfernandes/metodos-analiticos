#  HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE
#  
#  To simulate with pseudo-random numbers automatically generated, use the options 'rndnumbersPerSeed' and 'seeds'
#    rndnumbersPerSeed: <value> (it is only used if the option 'seeds' is declared)
#    seeds: (list of seed values used to automatically generate the pseudo-random numbers) 
#    - 1
#    - 2
#  
#  To simulate with a given list of pseudo-random numbers, use option 'rndnumbers'
#    rndnumbers: (list of pseudo-random numbers to be used during the simulation)
#    - 0.2176
#    - 0.0103
#    - 0.1109
#  
#  IMPORTANT:
#    * If the option 'seeds' is used, 'rndnumbers' is ignored. In this case, delete 'rndnumbers'
#      and its list of pseudo-random numbers
#  
#  The remainder details in this file is self-explained. Good-luck! :-)
#  
#  DO NOT DELETE THE NEXT LINE STARTED BY '!'
